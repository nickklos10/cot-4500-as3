# Numerical Methods Script

This script provides solutions to a variety of numerical methods problems using Python. It includes implementations of the Euler and Runge-Kutta methods for solving ordinary differential equations, Gaussian elimination with backward substitution for solving linear systems, LU Factorization, and checks for matrix properties (diagonally dominant and positive definite).

### Features

- Euler method for solving differential equations
- 4th-order Runge-Kutta method
- Gaussian elimination and backward substitution
- LU Factorization using SciPy
- Matrix property checks: diagonally dominant and positive definit

### Requirements

Requirements instructions will be found in the requirements.txt file in the repository

### Running the script

To use the script, simply run it in your preferred Python environment. The script is self-contained and does not require any additional input once the initial conditions are set within the script.

python main.py

### Structure

The script is divided into several function definitions followed by their execution. The results are printed to the console.

- Euler and Runge-Kutta Methods: Solve the specified differential equation.
- Gaussian Elimination: Solve the linear system represented by the augmented matrix.
- LU Factorization: Perform factorization on a given matrix and print the L, U, and determinant.
- Matrix Property Checks: Print out whether a matrix is diagonally dominant or positive definite.
